## ✨ Implemented Core Features & Mechanics

* [x] **🔮 Realm Citadels & Dyson Sphere Territory Holds (Pokémon GO Style Gyms):** 
  * **$0.01 Capsule Drop:** Automatically rolls a Common (50%), Rare (30%), Epic (15%), or Legendary (5%) permanent Capsule upon reaching $\ge \$0.01$ balance.
  * **10X Colossal Monuments:** Plantable directly at your feet on any unowned parcel with real-time growth countdowns evolving into towering 10X tall glassmorphism monuments with nested rotating kinetic rings and ground stronghold parcels.
  * **Multiplayer Garrison Defense:** Station 3D avatars inside holds with live defense tickers (`05D : 12H : 23M : 02s`) and guaranteed hourly Diamond & EB harvesting (scaling up to 24 Diamonds + ~72 EB/day for Legendary).
  * **Reflex Meter Siege Duels:** Walk within 100m, spend 1 Diamond, and time your strike in the gold zone to shatter the defender's shield, dethrone them, and earn a **+5 EB Conquest Bounty** (defender keeps 100% of banked loot!).
  * **Anti-Abuse Proximity & Prerequisite Locks:** Players must have planted their own Citadel before launching sieges, and cannot attack any Citadel within **250 meters** of their own home Hold (friendly neighborhood treaty).
* [x] **⚡ Citadel Evolution & Upgrade Forge:**
  * **Ascension Progression:** Upgrade existing holds through **Common $\rightarrow$ Rare $\rightarrow$ Epic $\rightarrow$ Legendary**!
  * **Dual-Currency Forge:** Spend either **Elden Bucks (EB)** or **Diamonds (◆)** as an active walking sink (*50 EB / 75 ◆ for Rare, 100 EB / 125 ◆ for Epic, 300 EB / 400 ◆ for Legendary*).

### 💰 27. Ad-Funded Treasury & Player Reward Economy

> **Core Economic Model:** The game is entirely free-to-play. Players never purchase land, currency, passive rent, boosts, inventory items, or other game assets with real-world money. The game is funded primarily through unobtrusive banner advertising and other approved advertising revenue. Gameplay generates an immutable in-game digital balance with no inherent real-world monetary value. Eligible players may eventually exchange a limited portion of their qualifying in-game balance for a promotional/reward payout subject to the game's weekly limits, eligibility rules, available treasury and applicable requirements.

* [ ] **27.1 🆓 100% Free-to-Play Foundation**

  * No mandatory purchase is required to play.
  * No player is required to deposit money into the game.
  * No player purchases are required to earn passive rent.
  * No player purchases are required to acquire land.
  * No player purchases are required to participate in the core economy.
  * Gameplay progression remains fundamentally free.

* [ ] **27.2 📢 Advertising-Funded Treasury**

  * Use small, persistent/non-interruptive banner advertising as the primary player-facing monetization mechanism.
  * Avoid forced full-screen advertisements that interrupt gameplay on a timed basis.
  * Avoid making players watch advertisements to perform ordinary gameplay actions.
  * Advertising revenue contributes to the operating treasury supporting:

    * Infrastructure
    * Development
    * Customer support
    * Security
    * Game operations
    * Expansion
    * Player rewards
  * Track advertising revenue separately from the player economy ledger.

* [ ] **27.3 🚀 Growing Treasury Model**

  * As the player base grows, advertising impressions and revenue can grow with it.
  * Treasury capacity should therefore be modeled as a function of:

    * Active players
    * Sessions
    * Ad impressions
    * Fill rate
    * Effective advertising revenue
    * Infrastructure costs
    * Operating expenses
    * Reward obligations
  * Never assume advertising revenue is guaranteed.
  * Build conservative treasury models using worst-case advertising conditions.

* [ ] **27.4 🏦 Protected Game Treasury**

  * Maintain a dedicated internal treasury accounting system.
  * Separate:

    * Operating funds
    * Advertising revenue
    * Reserved player reward obligations
    * Available reward budget
    * Pending payouts
    * Completed payouts
  * The game client must never have authority over treasury values.

---

### 🪙 28. Immutable Digital Player Balance

* [ ] **28.1 🔒 Immutable In-Game Balance**

  * Player passive rent and other qualifying rewards are represented through an authoritative server-side ledger.
  * The client displays the balance but never determines the authoritative balance.
  * Client-side manipulation must never be capable of creating currency.

* [ ] **28.2 0️⃣ No Intrinsic Asset Value**

  * In-game land, buildings, cosmetics, inventory items, boosts and digital rent balances have no inherent real-world monetary value.
  * Game assets cannot be sold directly by players.
  * Game assets cannot be purchased from the game using real-world currency.
  * Game assets are not player deposits.
  * Game assets are not intended to function as an investment product.

* [ ] **28.3 📜 Immutable Transaction History**

  * Record every material economy event as an append-only transaction.
  * Examples:

    * Passive rent generated
    * Rent claimed
    * Bonus awarded
    * Bonus removed
    * Game adjustment
    * Qualifying balance conversion
    * Withdrawal/reward request
  * Never silently overwrite historical financial/economic records.

* [ ] **28.4 🧮 Server-Side Accounting**

  * Final balances are calculated and validated server-side.
  * Every transaction receives:

    * Unique transaction ID
    * Player ID
    * Timestamp
    * Transaction type
    * Amount
    * Source
    * Destination
    * Reason
    * Processing status
  * Duplicate requests must never create duplicate rewards.

---

### 💵 29. Controlled Withdrawal / Reward Mechanism

> **The player's in-game balance remains a digital game balance. The withdrawal mechanism is a separate, controlled reward process.**

* [ ] **29.1 🎁 Limited Reward Eligibility**

  * Players may become eligible to request a limited reward based on qualifying in-game balance.
  * Eligibility does not mean the entire game balance becomes withdrawable.
  * The player must have sufficient qualifying in-game balance to support the requested conversion.

* [ ] **29.2 🔄 Balance-to-Reward Conversion**

  * A player voluntarily forfeits/deducts the required amount of qualifying in-game balance.
  * The system records the deduction permanently.
  * The corresponding reward request is created.
  * The player cannot spend the same balance twice.
  * Conversion must be atomic:

    * Either the balance deduction and reward reservation both succeed,
    * or neither occurs.

* [ ] **29.3 📅 Weekly Player Reward Limit**

  * Establish a maximum reward amount available to an individual player during a rolling 7-day period.
  * The weekly limit is independent from the player's total in-game balance.
  * A player may possess a large digital balance while still being restricted to the configured weekly reward ceiling.
  * Unused weekly capacity does not necessarily need to accumulate indefinitely.

* [ ] **29.4 🏦 Treasury-Constrained Rewards**

  * The theoretical weekly player limit is not a promise of unlimited payouts.
  * Actual reward processing remains subject to:

    * Treasury availability
    * Fraud/risk controls
    * Eligibility
    * System integrity
    * Payment-provider availability
    * Applicable geographic/operational restrictions
  * Treasury protection always takes priority over unrestricted reward issuance.

* [ ] **29.5 🛑 Reward Circuit Breaker**

  * Administrators can temporarily pause new reward requests without shutting down the game.
  * Existing game functionality can continue while the reward system is investigated.
  * Emergency suspension can be triggered automatically by predefined risk thresholds.

  * Automatically reduce or pause reward processing if:

    * Treasury reserves fall below configured levels.
    * Reward requests spike unexpectedly.
    * Advertising revenue drops substantially.
    * Currency generation becomes abnormal.
    * Fraud increases.
    * A game exploit is detected.

* [ ] **30.5 🌎 Global Reward Limits**

  * Establish configurable global:

    * Daily reward ceilings
    * Weekly reward ceilings
    * Hourly processing limits
    * Maximum concurrent payout exposure
  * These limits protect the game from unexpected demand spikes.

### 🚀 43. Final Launch Philosophy

### The game should scale in this order:

**FREE GAME**
↓
**PLAYER GROWTH**
↓
**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAY**
↓
**PASSIVE RENT GENERATION**
↓
**BANNER AD IMPRESSIONS**
↓
**AD REVENUE**
↓
**GAME TREASURY**
↓
**CONTROLLED PLAYER REWARD CAPACITY**
↓
**MORE PLAYER GROWTH**
↓
**MORE AD REVENUE**
↓
**MORE DEVELOPMENT**
↓
**MORE CONTENT**
↓
**LARGER PLAYER BASE**

The fundamental objective is **not to extract money from players.**

The objective is to build a sustainable free game where:

**Players provide attention → advertisers provide revenue → the game treasury funds operations and player rewards → successful growth creates more advertising revenue → the game becomes capable of supporting a larger ecosystem.**

---

# 🔐 Non-Negotiable Economic Security Rule

**The player's game balance must never be treated as a bank account.**

It is an **immutable digital game-state balance** generated through gameplay.

The reward mechanism is separate.

Conceptually:

**Gameplay**
→ generates digital game balance

**Digital game balance**
→ has no intrinsic real-world value

**Player becomes eligible**
→ according to game rules

**Player voluntarily forfeits qualifying game balance**
→ conversion request is created

**Weekly player limit**
→ caps reward exposure

**Risk engine**
→ validates request

**Treasury**
→ verifies available reward capacity

**Reward processor**
→ processes eligible reward

**Ledger**in mm
→ permanently records the result

This separation is extremely important because it prevents the game's internal economy from becoming conceptually equivalent to a player-held cash wallet.
